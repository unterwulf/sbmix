SBMIX makes it possible to control SB16-compatible sound card mixer
settings right from DOS command prompt.

It should work on anything compatible with Intel i8086 processor
and MS-DOS 2.0.

It's inspired by the same name utility by BTTR software [1]. In contrast
with the latter this version is written in pure Assembly (NASM), not
in Pascal, so the size is about two times smaller.
